<p>
	I'm a young graphic designer deeply connected with sound design field. Constantly balanced between visual creation, and sonic exploration, i'm looking for a meeting point trough these practices. As the Graphic Design is the lifeblood of my future activity i work for custom purpose, doing my best to give a specific approach regarding to each request in any domain.<br><br>

Since I don't have any status yet, i cannot handle any paid project but only non commercial ones which can be valuable for me. If you are a music producer, student, or motion designer that needs sound design skills or communication tool for personnal projects, feel free to get in touch.<br> <br>
