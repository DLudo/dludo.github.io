Campaign lauchned in the context of the montreal design
open gates. The agency found an intersting idea around the
web to sensibilize common people about the creatives jobs.
The idea of the web, was to exanche and explain
the design thinking of magma around a cotton candy. 

We asked every visitors to tie a cotton string in the studio,
proving that big ideas comes from a team work.
